# Covid-19 Time Series

We retrieve data regarding global Covid-19 confirmed, death and recovered cases (provided by [JHU CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)), clean it to our liking and then perform some analysis and visualisations.

By plotting US confirmed daily cases on a semi logarithmic plot, we can see that there was a short period of exponentional growth from about 2nd March to 22nd March, which is when stay-at-orders were beggining to be anounced. It seems that the lockdown procedures were successful in significantly reducing tranmission numbers.

By plotting the daily confirmed cases for each country/ province, overlayed on a world map, we get a nice visulation of how the pandemic spread across the globe. We can see that it starts in Wuhan, China and then isolated hotspots appears thoughout the rest of the world which gradually grow.
